  ## Description 
  Click here to [view the deployed app](https://fast-headland-69247.herokuapp.com/)
  <br>
  I built this app to keep track of the users fitness achiecments and compile a database of their most recent workouts. When the user is prompted to enter either cardio or resitance for an exercise type they are then taken to the next page where they specify which workout they did, how many reps and for how long.

  Once all of the fields are filled out, the information that they provide is then appended to a series of graphs and into the workout database.
